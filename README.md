# css-grid-responsive
An example of a CSS grid with responsive media breakpoints

View on github pages: https://cjshaw1976.github.io/css-grid-responsive/
And resize your browser window to see the media breakpoint changes.

This example is based on the Treehouse course: https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-grid-layout
